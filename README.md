This repository holds my implemenetations of some Machine Learning algorithms such as K-NN, PCA,  LDA, QDA,  Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, and more. The challenges were provided by CSE2510 Machine Learning course by TU Delft. Although these weren't graded, it helped me get full points in the implementation questions during the exam.
